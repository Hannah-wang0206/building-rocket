# Synthesis Space Program
Welcome to our aerospace science popularization interactive page, a virtual platform designed for aerospace enthusiasts.
Here, you will have the opportunity to take on the role of an aerospace worker and experience the entire process from designing to launching a rocket.
With the help of controlnet-scribble, you can turn your rocket design sketches into realistic images.
Not only that, but you can also input flight operation parameters such as fuel and initial velocity, and perform calculations using equations like Tsiolkovsky's to simulate the rocket's trajectory and orbit.
