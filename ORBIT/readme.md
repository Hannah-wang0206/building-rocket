# Orbital Path Visualization
## Overview
#### We have initially identified three planets to choose from (the Moon, Venus, and Mars), and we hope to adjust the launch orbit through user control in this section. The following is a simplified process of rocket launch: In the case of the Moon, the user only experiences one ignition and directly enters the Earth-Moon transfer orbit after launch. In the case of Venus and Mars, after the user's initial ignition, the rocket is launched into a low orbit around the Earth, and after a second ignition, it enters the transfer orbit and finds the right time on the transfer orbit to enter the orbit of the target planet. User input can change the transfer orbit.
#### In this section, we aim to study how the parameters entered by the user specifically change the shape of the transfer orbit and the launch results.

## 11.17 Update
#### This version realizes the visualization of the transfer orbit changing in real time with user input. More user input variables need to be further considered and incorporated.


## 11.18 Update
#### This version add user control with factors input (velocity, angle, fuel), and their restriction.
