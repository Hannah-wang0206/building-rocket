# ## Future Development Directions: Frontend and Backend Version

## Overview

Except for the functional streamlit version,  this represents the future concept of both the frontend and backend for a web-based application. 

## Timeline

- **Mid November:**  
  The project concept and plan were finalized, including the design of the web interface.
  
- **End November:**  
  The frontend HTML code for the pages was completed, allowing for basic layout and functionality. However, communication issues arose between the frontend and backend.

## Current Status

Currently, the frontend and backend are not communicating correctly. While the frontend renders the pages and the image generation process works fine in the backend, the generated images do not appear on the frontend.

- **Issue Identified:**  
  The **image generation** functionality works as expected when inspected using **F12 Developer Tools**, but the generated image fails to display on the webpage.

- **Development Plan**  

1. **Frontend and Backend Communication Fixes**:
   - Resolve the issue where generated images do not appear on the frontend.
   - Investigate and fix communication protocols between the backend (image generation) and the frontend (display).

2. **Image Display Optimization**:
   - Ensure that generated images are correctly received by the frontend.
   - Optimize the frontend to display the images efficiently, considering factors such as image resolution and loading times.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement better error handling and logging mechanisms to track issues related to image generation and frontend rendering.
   - Add appropriate user messages in case of errors or failures in image rendering.

4. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Further enhance the user interface based on user feedback and internal testing.
   - Focus on responsiveness and ease of use.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure proper communication between the frontend and backend.
   - Use both automated and manual testing methods to ensure all components are working as expected.

## Current Version - Streamlit Project
For a working demonstration of the implemented features, please refer to the homepage of the Streamlit project, where we have showcased the current functional version of the project.

We will continue to work on resolving the identified issues and pushing for further optimizations in the coming weeks.
