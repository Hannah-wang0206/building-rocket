# Initial Concept - Frontend and Backend Version

## Overview

This project represents the initial concept of both the frontend and backend for a web-based application. The application demonstrates a web interface and server-side operations for generating images based on user input.

## Timeline

- **Early November:**  
  The project concept and plan were finalized, including the design of the web interface.
  
- **Mid November:**  
  The frontend HTML code for the pages was completed, allowing for basic layout and functionality. However, communication issues arose between the frontend and backend.

## Current Status

Currently, the frontend and backend are not communicating correctly. While the frontend renders the pages and the image generation process works fine in the backend, the generated images do not appear on the frontend.

- **Issue Identified:**  
  The **image generation** functionality works as expected when inspected using **F12 Developer Tools**, but the generated image fails to display on the webpage.

## Solution

Due to the communication issues between the frontend and backend, we decided to pivot to **Streamlit** as the final presentation tool. Streamlit allows us to quickly deploy and display the application's functionalities without the complexities of frontend-backend communication issues.
